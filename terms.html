    <h1>Terms of Service — VeriShot Location Proof</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 12, 2026</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the VeriShot Location Proof

    </p>

    <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>
      VeriShot provides tools for capturing photos with associated verification metadata
      such as timestamps and location coordinates.
      You are responsible for how you use and share any content created with the app.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Content</h2>
    <p>
      Photos and proof records you create remain your property.
      You grant VeriShot permission to store and display this content locally on your device
      to provide app functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      VeriShot may offer auto-renewable subscriptions through Apple’s In-App Purchase system.
      Payment is charged to your Apple ID account.
      Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end
      of the current period.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
      You agree not to use the app for unlawful, misleading, or harmful purposes,
      including falsifying or misrepresenting verification data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      VeriShot is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind.
      Verification data is provided for informational purposes and should not be relied upon
      as legal proof.

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, VeriShot shall not be liable for any damages
      arising from use of the app.
    </p>
