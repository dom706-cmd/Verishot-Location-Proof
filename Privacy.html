# Privacy Policy — VeriShot Location Proof

**Effective date:** January 12, 2026

VeriShot Location Proof (“VeriShot,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices when you use the VeriShot Location Proof mobile application (the “App”).

## 1) Information We Collect

### A. Information you provide in the App
- **Photos you capture**: The App allows you to take and store photos as “proof” records.
- **Verification metadata**: The App may associate proof records with metadata such as **timestamp** and **location coordinates** (latitude/longitude) when you create a proof.

### B. Automatically collected information
- **Device and app diagnostics (optional)**: If you enable system-level crash reporting or Apple diagnostics, Apple may provide aggregated diagnostics to help improve stability.

### C. Purchases and subscriptions
- The App may offer **in-app purchases and/or subscriptions** processed by Apple via the App Store.  
- We do **not** collect or store your full payment information. Apple handles payments.

## 2) How We Use Information

We use information to:
- Create and display your proof records (photos + verification metadata).
- Provide core App functionality (camera, gallery, map views).
- Enforce plan limits and subscription access (free vs paid features).
- Improve App reliability and fix bugs.

## 3) Data Storage & Retention

### On-device storage
Proof records (including photos and any associated metadata) are stored **locally on your device** unless you choose to share them.

### Retention
- Proof data remains on your device until you delete it from within the App or remove the App from your device (which typically removes the App’s local data).

## 4) Sharing & Disclosure

We do **not** sell your personal information.

We may share data only in these cases:
- **When you choose to share**: If you use iOS sharing features, you choose where proof content is sent (e.g., Messages, Mail, cloud storage).
- **Service providers (limited)**: Apple processes in-app purchases/subscriptions.
- **Legal**: If required to comply with a legal obligation.

## 5) Location Permissions

If you grant location permission, the App can record location coordinates to support proof verification.  
You can change location permissions at any time in **iOS Settings**.

## 6) Your Choices

You can:
- Deny or revoke location permission in iOS Settings.
- Delete proof records within the App.
- Uninstall the App to remove local App data.

## 7) Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8) Security

We use reasonable safeguards to protect information stored within the App. No method of storage is 100% secure, but we aim to protect your data.

## 9) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above when changes are made.
