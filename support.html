## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is VeriShot Location Proof?
VeriShot Location Proof allows you to capture photos that include verification metadata such as timestamp and location coordinates. These proof records are stored on your device and can be viewed, shared, or managed by you.

---

### Where is my data stored?
All photos and verification data are stored **locally on your device** unless you choose to share them using iOS sharing features.

We do not upload your photos or proof data to our own servers.

---

### Why does the app request location access?
Location access allows the app to attach latitude and longitude data to a photo at the moment it is captured, helping establish proof of where a photo was taken.

You can enable or disable location access at any time in **iOS Settings**.

---

### How do subscriptions work?
VeriShot offers optional subscriptions that unlock higher verification limits and additional features.

- Payments are handled securely by Apple via the App Store.
- Subscription status is managed through your Apple ID.
- You can manage or cancel your subscription in **iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**.
